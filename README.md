# Rookie Programming Language

This is the programming language project of Group 4 from BSCS 3-5 for **COSC 30063 - Principles of Programming Language**.

This langauge is designed for beginners in programming, Rookie utilizes a readable syntax and an improved error checking. The language's syntax and rules draw inspiration from well-established languages such as C# and JavaScript, while its natural language approach is solely influenced by Python.
